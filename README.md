WORKING WITH PYTHON 3

The script needs the following libraries:
* Requests
* Tkinter


Pros and Cons:
- A very tiny window (200x100 px).
- Auto refresh every 5 minutes.
- Shows last refresh.( need to be fixed )
- Shows Storj balance , Storj complessive value and Eth balance.
- Impossible to move
- the starting (and fixed) position maybe change depending on the screen


CHANGELOG VERSION 1.5:
 * fixed the "get stuck" bug moving sleep and refresh functions to a subprocess
 * added an exit button (before impossible to use because of previous bug)
 * changed the dimensions of the gui
 
 TO DO:
 - fix the starting and fixed position
 - add possibility to move the gui
