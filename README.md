WORKING WITH PYTHON 3


Pros:
- A very tiny window (210x75 px).
- Auto refresh every 5 minutes.
- Shows last refresh.
- Shows Storj balance , Storj complessive value and Eth balance.
Cons:
- Impossible to move
- 'sleep' function causes "not responding" message
- the starting (and fixed) position maybe change depending on the screen
- to close the program you have to use Task manager or similar (kill python 3 process)
